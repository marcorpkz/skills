# Protocol

The MCP server is a stdio MCP process for AI coding agents and a localhost HTTP queue for Roblox Studio.

Studio plugins cannot reliably accept inbound sockets, so the plugin polls the Node server:

1. Plugin posts `/plugin/register` with the shared token and place metadata.
2. Plugin long-polls `POST /plugin/poll` with the shared token in the JSON body.
3. MCP tool calls enqueue commands.
4. Plugin executes a command in Studio and posts `/plugin/result`.
5. Optional plugin logs go to `/plugin/output`.

Default bind is `127.0.0.1:3765`. Non-loopback binds are refused.

The pre-release GET polling route was removed so credentials never appear in request URLs. Plugin and server must be updated together.

## Command envelope

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "map_apply_scene_spec",
  "args": {},
  "createdAt": "2026-07-07T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Result envelope

```json
{
  "token": "shared token",
  "commandId": "uuid",
  "ok": true,
  "result": {}
}
```

## SceneSpec build flow

1. Convert the prompt into a SceneSpec with `mapName`, `rootPath`, terrain, zones, instances, `functionalObjects`, and optional scripts.
2. Use `Workspace/MapDrafts` for new maps.
3. Set `layout.grounding` for placed maps. Default `mode=raycast` samples the current Workspace surface; `mode=manual` uses `groundY`; `mode=none` is only for intentional sky/void maps.
4. Organize multilevel maps with named folders/models and unique instance names.
5. Include a readable player route: spawn, path, entry platform, and a functional door/opening.
6. Put doors, buttons, lifts, teleporters, and checkpoints in `functionalObjects`; the plugin adds ProximityPrompts and a scoped `MapInteractions` runtime script. Doors should set `autoCloseSeconds` unless they are intentionally persistent. When a visible door panel already exists in `instances`, set `target` to that part instead of creating a second functional door.
7. Set `codegen.target` to `studio`, `rojo`, or `both`. `both` writes runtime/scripts into Studio and mirrors Luau plus `default.project.json` under `generated/rojo/<mapName>`.
8. Call `map_apply_scene_spec` with `dryRun=true`; review target root, counts, services, and risks.
9. Call `map_apply_scene_spec` with `dryRun=false`; run `map_validate` with `strictGeometry=true`; then run `map_readiness_check` with the correct profile.

`map_validate` checks the safe root, spawn count, anchoring, terrain penetration on player surfaces, stair landing/headroom, and likely solid overlaps. It is not final visual readiness. `map_readiness_check` is the final contract gate for visible assemblies such as house doors, balconies, roofs, and stair headroom. Warnings are not fatal, but a generator should treat terrain intersections, unreachable stairs, ceiling-blocked stairs, blocked doorways, and broken facade contracts as rebuild triggers.

For iterative visual repair, use `studio_patch_instances` for batched create/set/delete edits inside generated roots. Use `studio_focus_instance` or `studio_set_camera` to move the Studio viewport, then `studio_visual_probe` to raycast a viewport grid and report visible hit parts before calling a build ready.

`Workspace/AI_Generated` is accepted only for migrating older maps.
